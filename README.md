# eASV-pipeline-for-515Y-926R
This is a collection of basic and evolving scripts for analyzing mixed 16S/18S amplicon sequences using bbtools, qiime2, deblur, biom, BLAST, and other tools.

Scripts are either python or shell scripts, and are designed for the pre-set conda environments on kraken.usc.edu. However, they do not require anything complex.

An associated protocol that describes the steps in more detail can be found here:
