# eASV-pipeline-for-515Y-926R
This is a collection of basic and evolving scripts for analyzing mixed 16S/18S amplicon sequences using bbtools, qiime2, deblur, biom, BLAST, and other tools.

Scripts are either python or bash scripts, and are designed for the pre-set conda environments on kraken.usc.edu. However, they do not require anything complex and could easily be reproduced elsewhere.

An associated protocol that describes the steps in more detail can be found here:
